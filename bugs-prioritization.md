# Angie project bugs/issues prioritization

# Bugs categorization
# 1. Blocker/Immediate
A bug is considered a must-fix.

# 2. Critical
 A critical bug is extremely important to fix.

# 3. High
A “high” severity bug has a significant impact on users or branding, and should be addressed soon.

# 4. Medium. 
A “medium” severity bug isn’t ideal, but may have a workaround. It should be fixed at some point, but not necessarily in the current sprint.

# 5. Low. 
A bug marked as “low” is not urgent. In fact, it may not even end up being fixed at all. These will typically be sitting in the backlog for awhile.
